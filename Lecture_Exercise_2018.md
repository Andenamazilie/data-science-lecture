<h1 id="exercise-introduction-to-data-science-2018">Exercise: Introduction to Data Science (2018)</h1>
<p>The entire exercise is split in two parts.</p>
<p>Part one is a simple introduction to a predefined problem and to learn basic skillsets.</p>
<p>Part two applies data science knowledge (business, method, interpretation, coding) on a new data set with a more realistic problem statement</p>

</table><h2 id="part-2">Part 2</h2>
<p>You are working as a data scientist for a company which maintaining a larger car fleet for their logistic services. The company hat a truck fleet (100) with an average milage per truck and year of 220 000 kms and operates in Gemany. The company would like to know:</p>
<p><strong>Can we define an added value for the company by knowing more about the gas prices?</strong></p>
<p>The provided data show an extraction of the gasoline prices in Germany. The full historic of the data can be accessed at: <a href="https://creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de">https://creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de</a>. There is as well a description of the data set</p>
<p><strong>Exercise Goal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn a systematic approach to deal with a high level business request</li>
<li>Learn a data driven approach to ask and answer the correct questions</li>
<li>Derive a possible business model and judge on what is possible or not</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="procedure">Procedure:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Understand the data</li>
<li>Define a possible business case</li>
<li>Develop a model</li>
<li>Analyze the result</li>
<li>Present the result</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="task1-understandanalyze-the-data">Task1: understand/analyze the data</h3>
<p>Questions to be answered (understand the data):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How many different locations are present in the data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many different brands are there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the min, max price for each gasoline type, per month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandatory Homework: Find 5 more questions which might be of interest and present the analytics results (visual plots)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="task-2-define-a-possible-business-potential">Task 2: define a possible business potential</h3>
<ul>
<li>Describe a possible business potential for the customer</li>
<li>Do high level calculations of the business case in €</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="task-3-develop-a-predictive-model">Task 3: develop a predictive model</h3>
<ul>
<li>write a predictor on the gasoline prices (define your horizon carefully)</li>
<li>start with a trivial predictor, enhance to a (possible) stronger model (scikit-learn)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="task-4-analyse-the-result">Task 4: Analyse the result</h3>
<ul>
<li>interpret the results from a mathematical perspective</li>
<li>interpret the result from a business perspective (think about the realistic assumption that a truck diver will not always follow the best decision)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="task-5-present-the-result">Task 5: Present the result</h3>
<p>Imagine you have 3-5 slides to present the result to a management board</p>
<ul>
<li>prepare the presentation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deadline-all-tasks-have-to-be-finished-one-week-before-the-oral-exam">Deadline: all tasks have to be finished one week before the oral exam</h3>
<ul>
<li>source code has to be uploaded to your GITHUB account</li>
<li>presentations can be uploaded to GITHUB or to the OLAT System</li>
</ul>
